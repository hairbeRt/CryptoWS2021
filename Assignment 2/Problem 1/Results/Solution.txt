THE LAST QUESTION WAS ASKED FOR THE FIRST TIME, HALF IN JEST, ON MAY 21, 2061, AT A TIME WHEN HUMANITY FIRST STEPPED INTO THE LIGHT. THE QUESTION CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF A FIVE-DOLLAR BET OVER HIGHBALLS, AND IT HAPPENED THIS WAY:

ALEXANDER ADELL AND BERTRAM LUPOV WERE TWO OF THE FAITHFUL ATTENDANTS OF MULTIVAC. AS WELL AS ANY HUMAN BEINGS COULD, THEY KNEW WHAT LAY BEHIND THE COLD, CLICKING, FLASHING FACE -- MILES AND MILES OF FACE -- OF THAT GIANT COMPUTER. THEY HAD AT LEAST A VAGUE NOTION OF THE GENERAL PLAN OF RELAYS AND CIRCUITS THAT HAD LONG SINCE GROWN PAST THE POINT WHERE ANY SINGLE HUMAN COULD POSSIBLY HAVE A FIRM GRASP OF THE WHOLE.

MULTIVAC WAS SELF-ADJUSTING AND SELF-CORRECTING. IT HAD TO BE, FOR NOTHING HUMAN COULD ADJUST AND CORRECT IT QUICKLY ENOUGH OR EVEN ADEQUATELY ENOUGH. SO ADELL AND LUPOV ATTENDED THE MONSTROUS GIANT ONLY LIGHTLY AND SUPERFICIALLY, YET AS WELL AS ANY MEN COULD. THEY FED IT DATA, ADJUSTED QUESTIONS TO ITS NEEDS AND TRANSLATED THE ANSWERS THAT WERE ISSUED. CERTAINLY THEY, AND ALL OTHERS LIKE THEM, WERE FULLY ENTITLED TO SHARE IN THE GLORY THAT WAS MULTIVAC'S.

FOR DECADES, MULTIVAC HAD HELPED DESIGN THE SHIPS AND PLOT THE TRAJECTORIES THAT ENABLED MAN TO REACH THE MOON, MARS, AND VENUS, BUT PAST THAT, EARTH'S POOR RESOURCES COULD NOT SUPPORT THE SHIPS. TOO MUCH ENERGY WAS NEEDED FOR THE LONG TRIPS. EARTH EXPLOITED ITS COAL AND URANIUM WITH INCREASING EFFICIENCY, BUT THERE WAS ONLY SO MUCH OF BOTH.

BUT SLOWLY MULTIVAC LEARNED ENOUGH TO ANSWER DEEPER QUESTIONS MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, AND ON MAY 14, 2061, WHAT HAD BEEN THEORY, BECAME FACT.
